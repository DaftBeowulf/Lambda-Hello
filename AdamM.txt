Hello there! My name is Adam McKenney.
I am:
-creative
-detail-oriented
-quick-thinking
My favorite hobby is playing video games. I like action RPGs just fine, but always have a soft-spot for turn-based RPGs. Best game of all time is still Ocarina of Time imo, but if you say Majora's Mask I'll allow it.
